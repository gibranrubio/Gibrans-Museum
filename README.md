# Gibrans-Museum
A game for my Airbnb guest in my Los Angeles, CA home to play for a chance to win coffee or breakfast on me during their stay.

# Description
A game to play when deciding to stay in my Los Angeles, CA Airbnb. Our art collection around the home is worth over 200 million dollars. Well they're reproductions but you get the point. Can you guess who the world famous painters are and some questions about our art filled home? If you can score 8 points then I will personally invite you to a breakfast and coffee during your stay!

# How To Play
The objective is to play the game while walking around the Airbnb. We have filled the home with wonderful art pieces so this like a scavenger hunt/Where is Waldo interactive quiz. 
1. You can only play once. Honor system.
2. You can look around the house while you play.
3. You can definitely use Google to help you.
4. You must get at least 8 points to win.
